Now hit `/new` and I'll watch for the probe to fire. | A: Go ahead and hit `/new` - I'm watching the log live.\n\n## Recent memory\n## agenr Memory Context\n\n### Preferences and Decisions\n\n- [agenr product roadmap - P0 then UI] Agreed roadmap: (1) Ship browse mode (#190, P0) to close the foundational architecture gap in temporal recall. (2) Then build the agenr web UI (#171) - the browse mode chronological view is the natural home screen. UI turns agenr from a CLI tool into something others can understand and use. 'Build it and they will come.' Dave's words on 2026-02-22.\n\n### Facts and Events\n\n- [session transcript formatting] A session transcript format was established with specific structure, including metadata, timestamps, and user-assistant exchanges, for reliable parsing and extraction.\n- [before_reset flow] The 'before_reset flow' is a critical process in agent session handling, with a need for comprehensive documentation for reliability and future lookup.\n- [session management flow] The session management involves `/new` command triggering `before_reset` to log a session handoff, followed by reading previous session JSONL, browsing for relevant info, and soft-deleting the handoff entry after use.\n- [session handoff 2026-02-23 12:xx] Structured session handoff entry to capture current branch, open PRs, recent completed actions, and next steps automatically at /new time.\n- [scripture rotation] Scripture rotation rules are among the top entries post `/new` to guide memory or context management. Psalm 4:8 is banned at importance 10, and scriptures are sent without repetition within 30 days.\n- [Psalm 4:8 in database jail] Psalm 4:8 has been marked as in database jail, indicating it is not currently accessible or active. User mentions 'Psalm 4:8 in database jail' as a high-importance entry, importance 10, indicating it is a critical or sensitive data note.\n- [scripture rotation] Psalm 4:8 has been retired from rotation in scripture list.\n- [Psalm scripture restrictions] Psalm scripture restrictions have been established as a high-importance rule. Psalm 4:8 is banned at importance 10, preventing it from being used as a scripture reminder.\n- [scripture rotation - do not repeat list] Scriptures already sent to Dave - DO NOT reuse these:\n\nEVENING: Psalm 4:8 (sent multiple times - BANNED), \n\nMORNING: Colossians 3:23-24 (Feb 22), Isaiah 40:31 (Feb 17), Proverbs 3:5-6 (early Feb), Proverbs 16:3 (early Feb)\n\nRule: before sending any scripture, recall this entry and verify the verse is not on this list. Draw from different books each time. Never repeat within 30 days.\n- [test handoff probe] Test probe for handoff signal sent during conversation with high importance (9).\n- [test handoff probe] testing before_reset store path\n- [importance levels for session handoff] Importance level for session handoff summary should be 9, not 10, to allow retirement after first use.\n- [content to send to LLM for session summary] Send only the last 20-30 turns of session history to the LLM for efficient summarization, avoiding full session JSONL.\n- [key components of session summary] Key components of session summary include crucial metadata and context details needed for session restoration.\n- [timing concern for before_reset event] The before_reset call site uses a detached async IIFE and does not await the hook, leading to a race condition during session startup.\n- [agenr session handling fix] Agenr fixed session handling in response to recent high-importance signal. Context cleanup status is under review.\n- [isThinPrompt bare /new bug] The 'isThinPrompt' needs an additional condition and tests for the bare-reset boilerplate string. Mentioned in issue #201, with root cause update. The current status of trust or bugs is unconfirmed; further investigation is required to determine if this is still relevant.\n- [agenr session fix for missing before_reset] A fix was implemented for agenr missing before_reset, involving reading the latest archived session messages from the most recent .reset.* file, with importance 9.\n- [Codex prompt file location - always MacBook] Codex prompts must always be saved to ~/Code/agenr/docs/internal/prompts/ on the MacBook in the repo, never to /tmp or other temp locations. Use SSH or SCP to write directly to this location.\n\n## Relevant memory\n## agenr Memory Context\n\n### Preferences and Decisions\n\n- [agenr mini update - Dave handles it] Dave handles all agenr version updates on the Mac mini himself (pnpm add -g, openclaw plugins update, gateway restart). BMA should NOT do this automatically after publish. Just announce the publish and let Dave take it from there.\n- [agenr fix for missing before_reset - archive file fallback] A fix was implemented for agenr missing before_reset, involving reading the latest archived session messages from the most recent .reset.* file.\n\n### Facts and Events\n\n- [agenr version 0.8.12] agenr@0.8.28 is live on npm and can be updated using pnpm. After update, restart the openclaw gateway and check gateway.err.log for the probe command hook firing.\n- [agenr version] agenr@0.8.28 is live.\n- [agenr v0.8.10 shipped] agenr v0.8.28 was published on 2026-02-24, with PR #217 merged. Fix: command hook as before_reset proxy for RPC-triggered /new (issue #210/#216). Adds readAndParseSessionJsonl(), runHandoffForSession() shared helper, command hook handler with dedup guard (Set<sessionId> 60s TTL). before_reset stays in place. 1107 tests passing. This update follows the v0.8.10 release published on February 22, 2026, which improved session-start recall using blending stash and handling high-signal prompts.\n- [OpenClaw command hook] The 'command' hook fires in two paths: auto-reply (when '/new' is typed in chat) and gateway RPC (sessions.reset). During reset, command hook triggers occur before session transcript files are archived, applicable in both auto-reply and gateway RPC paths, with filtering on `event.action` and reading JSONL manually.\n- [/new command execution] The /new command at 10:01pm CST should have generated a sessions.reset line but is uncertain if it went through or if the log already reset.\n- [agenr plugin load failure in new session] The agenr plugin successfully registered after restart at 03:53:31, with previous plugin not found error resolved after installing version 0.8.26.\n- [agenr version] The system attempted to install agenr@0.8.21 which does not exist; it remains at version 0.8.14.\n- [agenr plugin patch] The openclaw plugin was updated at ~02:48 by replacing plugin files without registering new hooks. The config shows a change at this time, but the new version lacks hook registration, causing configuration discrepancies.\n- [agenr software version] agenr process version 0.8.24 confirmed as active.\n- [OpenClaw gateway plist behavior] After upgrading, the openclaw gateway plist hardcodes the pnpm store path and must be re-run and restarted to reflect new binaries, as merely restarting the gateway is insufficient.\n- [Current Clawdbot/OpenClaw setup] User is now running OpenClaw 2026.1.29 on their system, with gateway active and properly configured; plugin version is 0.8.22.\n- [agenr development milestone] Agenr shipped 8 versions in one day, fixed a metadata poisoning bug, implemented webchat recall end-to-end, and passed 1,045 tests, marking a significant productivity milestone.\n- [agenr development milestone] Successfully shipped 8 versions in one day, fixed metadata poisoning, implemented webchat recall, and passed over 1,045 tests, marking a productivity milestone.\n- [agenr project directory] The agenr source code directory contains files such as auth-status.ts, cli.ts, cli-main.ts, commands, config.ts, consolidate, db, dedup.ts, embeddings, extractor.ts, ingester.ts, llm, mcp, openclaw-plugin, output.ts, parser.ts, platform.ts, and project.ts.\n- [openclaw.plugins.update] OpenClaw ver 0.8.25 verifies the current installed version's hash against stored hash for integrity to prevent mismatches during updates.\n- [agenr gateway status] Agenr gateway is verified to be running clean and correctly in the current session.\n- [agent version update process] User will handle updating the macmini with the latest agenr versions.\n- [agenr memory optimization] Agenr has a session-memory hook that can be removed as part of its memory optimization.\n- [agenr release v0.8.14] agenr version 0.8.21 includes a fix confirmed in the distribution.\n- [agenr gateway version] Proper agenr plugin setup involves using the documented flow, restoring configuration after installation, and restarting the gateway to ensure correct operation. The plugin loading process requires a restart of the gateway, which temporarily drops the exec connection, but is necessary to apply updates successfully. Gateway restart at 20:46:42 after installing agenr plugin with a non-standard version.\n- [npm package agenr] The agenr package was updated from version 0.8.22 to 0.8.23.\n- [plugin code version mismatch] The plugin on mini is running old code despite package.json indicating version 0.8.22, likely due to improper rebuild or update.\n- [agenr openclaw plugin code] The script maintains a session topic stash with a TTL of 1 hour, filtering topics based on length and word count to determine if they are stash-eligible.\n- [agenr release v0.8.14] Agenr versions 0.8.10 to 0.8.14 were all shipped today, marking a major release milestone.\n- [OpenClaw plugin registration bug] The registration and dispatch of the 'before_reset' event hook in the Agenr source code is being verified for correctness, similar to known hook registration issues that occur when returning a Promise improperly.\n- [OpenClaw gateway version] The OpenClaw gateway was updated to version 2026.2.22, and recent fixes included session routing and background timeout enhancements.\n- [agenr prompt update process] The prompt was updated to include fixes, tests, changelog, and version bump to 0.8.23, preparing for pasting into Codex.\n- [agenr project] agenr is on version 0.8.23, which is newer than the 0.8.22 documented in MEMORY.md.\n- [version bump and rebuild process for release] To update the package, need to bump version to 0.8.20, rebuild dist on MacBook, create PR, merge, and publish. Before publishing, verify that the dist directory contains the latest build code, including 'isColdStart' and browse mode session-start path, then increment version, create PR, merge, and publish.\n- [agenr issue #196] Logged at https://github.com/agenr-ai/agenr/issues/196\n- [agenr session start prompt] The session start prompt on MacBook covers updates like removing _TTL alias, defining SESSION_QUERY_LOOKBACK, and including unit tests.\n- [agenr database architecture] agenr database architecture is a key component of the system, and recent upgrade to openclaw should prevent timeouts.\n- [agenr development milestones] In just over one week, agenr shipped several features including bulk ingest, signal engine, model-aware output budgeting, session-start recall blending, metadata stripping, archive fallback, cross-surface memory, version 0.8.14, OpenClaw integration, watcher, plugin system, and swarm review workflow.\n- [/new command behavior in OpenClaw] Running a `/new` command in OpenClaw causes the system to forget previous context, indicating that context memory is reset on this command.\n- [openclaw gateway plist hardcoded path] OpenClaw gateway plist has a hardcoded path that does not update automatically after `pnpm add -g openclaw@latest`. It requires re-running `openclaw gateway install` and restarting the gateway to reflect the new version after an upgrade.\n- [agenr development milestones] agenr shipped several features including bulk ingest, signal engine, model-aware output budgeting, and OpenClaw integration within a week.\n- [agenr plugin in OpenClaw] User inquired if a warning message appeared about agenr accessing CLI and cautioning about credential theft.\n- [agenr v0.6.15] agenr version 0.6.15 has been released on npm with changes including fixes to the watcher, daemon, logs, and process management. It is a clean, tested build with 712 passing tests.\n- [agenr SDK] The agenr SDK now fully supports the AGP confirmation flow, with prepare, execute, and confirm steps. It passes all tests, is type-safe, and documented in the README.\n- [OpenClaw plugin update process] The process to update the OpenClaw plugin involves manually extracting the correct npm tarball, patching the config, and then restarting the gateway to load the new plugin version.\n- [actions and decisions in session f40d0df0] Confirmed npm package shipped successfully, memory status checked, social media draft noted, heartbeat polling verified, and remote cleanup performed.\n- [openclaw session f40d0df0] Topics discussed included agenda management, memory health, npm publishing, social media reply planning, and heartbeat monitoring.\n\nA new session was started via /new or /reset. Execute your Session Startup sequence now - read the required files before responding to the user. Then greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning."}],"timestamp":1771908695518}}
