# Why AGPL-3.0?

agenr started as MIT. We switched to AGPL-3.0 before public launch. Here's why.

## What AGPL means for you

**If you're an individual or open-source project:** Nothing changes. Use agenr freely. Modify it. Build on it. Share it. The only requirement is that if you distribute your modifications, you share them under the same license.

**If you're a company using agenr internally:** Nothing changes. AGPL only triggers when you offer the software as a service to others.

**If you're a company offering agenr as a hosted service:** You must open-source your modifications. Or contact us for a commercial license.

## Why we made this choice

agenr is a memory system. We're building something that gets more valuable the more people use it, contribute to it, and improve it. Open source is core to that mission.

But we've watched what happened to Redis, Elasticsearch, and MongoDB. Large cloud providers took their open-source work, offered it as a managed service, and gave nothing back. The original creators had to change their licenses after the fact -- which is messy and fractures communities.

We'd rather be honest about it from day one.

AGPL protects the community's investment. If someone builds a commercial service on agenr, the improvements flow back to everyone. If you want to build a proprietary product with agenr inside, we offer commercial licensing -- that's how we sustain development.

## What this means in practice

- Personal use: free, always
- Open-source projects: free, always
- Internal company use: free, always
- Building a commercial hosted service: contact us for a commercial license
- Contributing back: always welcome, always appreciated

## The short version

We believe in open source. We also believe the people who build things should benefit from them. AGPL lets us do both.
