    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>By accessing or using the Agenr platform ("Service"), including the agenr.ai website, API, and Developer Console, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree, do not use the Service.</p>

    <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
    <p>Agenr provides a trust and commerce layer between AI agents and businesses. The Service includes an API platform, adapter generation and execution, credential management, and a Developer Console for managing integrations.</p>

    <h2>3. Accounts</h2>
    <p>To use certain features, you must sign in via a supported OAuth provider (Google or GitHub). You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and any API keys associated with it. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any unlawful purpose or in violation of any applicable laws</li>
      <li>Attempt to gain unauthorized access to other users' accounts, credentials, or data</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the Service or its infrastructure</li>
      <li>Use the Service to transmit malware, spam, or other harmful content</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to extract the source code of any proprietary components</li>
      <li>Exceed published rate limits or abuse API access</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Credentials and Security</h2>
    <p>You may store API keys, OAuth tokens, and other credentials through the Service for use with adapters. You are solely responsible for the credentials you store and the third-party services they access. Agenr encrypts stored credentials at rest but does not guarantee the security of the third-party services those credentials access.</p>

    <h2>6. Adapters</h2>
    <p>Adapters are integrations that connect AI agents to business APIs. Adapters may be generated dynamically or provided by the community. Agenr executes adapters in sandboxed environments but does not guarantee that adapter code is free of bugs or security vulnerabilities. You use adapters at your own risk.</p>

    <h2>7. Open Source</h2>
    <p>The Agenr platform is released under the MIT License. These Terms govern your use of the hosted Service at agenr.ai. Self-hosted deployments are governed solely by the MIT License.</p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>You retain ownership of any content, credentials, or adapter code you create or upload. By submitting adapters for public use, you grant Agenr a non-exclusive, worldwide license to host, run, and distribute that adapter code under the MIT License.</p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. Agenr does not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted, error-free, or secure. Use of the Service is at your sole risk.</p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, Agenr shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, arising from your use of the Service.</p>

    <h2>11. Termination</h2>
    <p>We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause, with or without notice. You may stop using the Service at any time. Upon termination, your right to use the Service ceases immediately.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.</p>

    <h2>13. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Texas, United States, without regard to conflict of law provisions.</p>

    <h2>14. Contact</h2>
